                        Pantry to Platter is my little corner of internet!
           It just started as a casual hobby a few years ago while I was left my college. I love eating food and trying out different cuisines. I also wanted the people to try out the different recipes which I make and enjoy , why should I have all the fun alone?? 
           With this I started working on this project which has reached to many of you .And, I'm glad people love the recipes which I've shared so far.
           I post fun recipes each month.
